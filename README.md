# My 1st Website

The was the first website that I designed and built. This was the main assignment
for the FWD (Fundamentals of Web Design) class in the Digital Media Associate
program at Full Sail in April 2005.

This was my first taste of HTML/CSS/JS

Noteables:

- That bg pattern had to be from Squid Fingers http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns/
- Check out the inline JS for the hover states on the nav
- While you're at it, check out the inline JS for the image gallery
- Papyrus everywhere
- Bowling Green Missouri is my hometown
